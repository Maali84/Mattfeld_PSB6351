# NODE 11: SPATIAL SMOOTHING
# You have a couple of options here...
# If you want to smooth isotropically you can use either AFNI's 3dmerge or FSL's fslmath
# For AFNI's implementation within the context of nipype check out the following page:
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.afni.utils.html#nipype.interfaces.afni.utils.Merge
# For FSL's implementation within the context of nipype check out hte following page:
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.fsl.utils.html#nipype.interfaces.fsl.utils.Smooth
# QUESTIONS TO ANSWER...
# Q1 - What does isotropic mean?
### Isoptropic means equal in all spatial directions. The gaussian smoothing kernel has the same width in the x, y and z directions in isotropic spatial smoothing.
# Q2 - What are the pros and cons of isotropic spatial smoothing?
### Isotropic smoothing is commonly used in fmri analysis as it is simple and computationally efficient. It also increases the SNR by averaging the signal across neighboring voxels. It helps reduce small spatial variations between subjects. Its limitation includes blurring across tissue and anatomical boundaries as same smoothing is applied in every direction irrespective of anatomy and tissue types. 

# AFNI has some cool tools to help control the final smoothness of your data
# Specifically 3dBlurToFWHM, this function will estimate your intrinsic smoothness and iteratively
# spatially blur up until it achieves a targeted smoothness

# Q3 - Why might this be good?  Are there any potential cons?
### 3dBlurtoFWHM is good as it considers the intrinsic smoothness of the image and iteratively adds smoothing until the requested final smoothing is reached. It could have high computational cost and long processing times. If it smoothes the image excessively, it could result in a decrease in spatial specificity.

# If you intend to use AFNI's 3dBlurToFWHM check out hte following page:
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.afni.preprocess.html#nipype.interfaces.afni.preprocess.BlurToFWHM
# NOTE: If you elect to use this one be careful on how big you make your
# kernel as this process is iterative and can take some time
# FSL has some cool tools that help ensure that you spatially smooth like voxels
# This is FSL's SUSAN algorithm, this function will use intensities in voxels
# to constrain smoothing to like intensities (smooth only grey matter with grey matter)
# Q4 - Why might his be good? Cons (hint: begins with an 'e' and ends with 'ge' effects)?
#      How might the cons influence Gaussian Random Field Theory?
### SUSAN can better preserve anatomical boundaries because voxels with substantially different intensities contribute less to one another. This can reduce undesirable smoothing across tissue boundaries and preserve spatial specificity. Cons include edge effects which means that near the boundaries, voxels have fewer similar intensity neighbors available for smoothing. That matters for Gaussian Random Field (GRF) theory because conventional GRF-based statistical inference relies on assumptions concerning the spatial smoothness of the statistical field. If smoothing varies substantially across space, particularly around edges, those assumptions may be less well satisfied and can affect cluster-based statistical inference.

# If you choose an isotropic approach or AFNI's 3dBlurToFWHM you need
# to add just a single node here.
#
# If you choose to use the FSL SUSAN approach, you'll need to add the following
# NODE 1 - FreeSurferSource node, define subjects_dir as the project's freesurfer directory
#          and define subject_id as the subject id

# NODE 2 - You will need to make a brain only mask.  I'm going to guide you to use freesurfers aparc+aseg
#          To do this you'll use freesurfer's binarize function
#          binarizing all values in the aparc+aseg file that are greater than 0.5
#          For this node to work connect the fssource node and in the connection syntax
#          imbed the get_aparc_aseg function that is already defined for you above
#          Use this node to also dilate your brian only mask in T1w space by 1 voxel

#          NOTE: This step is best implemented if you used Freesurfer's BBREGISTER for coregistration
#          You have to define where you're going aka 'source_file' and what is moving aka 'target_file'

# Q5 - why is nearest neighbor interpolation correct here? What is nearest neighbor interpolation?
### Because nearest neighbor interpolation assigns each output voxel the value of the nearest voxel in the original image.

#          you can use FSL's fslmaths and the '-mas' flag to work here

# NODE 12: TEMPORAL FILTERING OR SMOOTHING
# I want you to add a node here to temporally filter the functional data --> should this be a mapnode or regular node? mapnode as we have multiple functional runs
# If the functional EPI data are resting state data I want you to implement a 
# bandpass filter. If the functional EPI data are task data I want you to implement
# a highpass filter.
# Q6 - why bandpass resting state but only highpass task EPI data?
### Because resting state fMRI uses band-pass filtering to isolate spontaneous BOLD fluctuations within a frequency range of interest, whereas task fMRI commonly uses high-pass filtering to remove slow temporal drift while preserving frequencies associated with the experimental paradigm.

# I want you to utilize either the FSL tools implementing fslmaths, what op_string flag would you need? '-bptf HIGH_PASS_SIGMA -1'
# sigma = cutt off secs/ 2* TR = 100/2*1.76 = 28.41
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.fsl.utils.html#nipype.interfaces.fsl.utils.ImageMaths
# Or you can use AFNI's 3dBandpass function
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.afni.preprocess.html#nipype.interfaces.afni.preprocess.Bandpass
# If you use AFNI's tool and you only highpass filter, how do you set your fbot and ftop?
# If you are electing to use the Discrete Cosine Tranforms (DCTs) to statistically account for low frequency noise
# you'll need to run a regression model.
# For this step I would recommend utilizing AFNI's 3dDeconvolve paired with 3dREMLfit
# First using 3dDeconvolve you'll need to 
# define your legendre input as True and your number of polorts as an integer - try 7..
# you can also make the x1D_stop flag True as you don't need to run the 3dDeconvolve as 3dREMLfit does the heavy lifting here
# create another node for the 3dREMLfit passing the x1D matrix from the 3dDeconvolve node and save in your datasink the residuals
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.afni.model.html#nipype.interfaces.afni.model.Deconvolve
